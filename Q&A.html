          <h2>Impotance of maintaining ones culture?</h2>
          <p>Culture is the lifeblood of a vibrant society. Exapressed in so many ways that we tell our stories, celebrate, remembering the past, entertain ourselves, and imagine the future. Our creative expression helps define who we are, helping us to see the world through the eyes of those around us. Maintaining one’s culture is important because it helps people stay connected to their identity, history, and community. 
            
          Culture includes traditions, language, food, music, values, and ways of living that are passed down from one generation to another. When we protect and practice our culture, we keep these special parts of our heritage alive.

          First, culture gives people a sense of identity. It helps us understand who we are and where we come from. When someone knows their cultural background, they often feel more confident and grounded. This identity can guide them in making decisions and understanding their place in the world. Without culture, people may feel lost or disconnected from their roots.

          Second, maintaining culture strengthens community bonds. Shared traditions and customs bring people together. Festivals, ceremonies, and cultural gatherings create a feeling of belonging. They allow individuals to celebrate together, support each other, and pass on knowledge to younger generations. These shared experiences help keep communities strong and united.

          Third, culture helps preserve history. Every culture carries stories, lessons, and wisdom from the past. When we continue practicing our cultural traditions, we keep these stories alive. This helps younger people learn about the struggles, achievements, and beliefs of their ancestors. By remembering the past, we learn valuable lessons that can guide us in the future.

          Fourth, cultural diversity makes the world more interesting and peaceful. When people maintain their different cultures, society becomes richer and more colorful. We get to experience new foods, languages, clothes, and ideas. Respecting and preserving various cultures also helps promote understanding among people. When we learn about others, we reduce prejudice and encourage harmony.

          Finally, culture gives comfort and strength. In difficult times, people often turn to their traditions, values, and beliefs for support. Culture can provide hope, guidance, and a sense of belonging. It reminds people that they are part of something bigger than themselves.

          In conclusion, maintaining one’s culture is important for identity, community, history, diversity, and emotional well being. It helps people stay connected to their roots and creates a richer, more understanding society. When we respect and protect our own culture—and the cultures of others we help build a world that values heritage, unity, and peace.</p>

          <h2>Why Pacific teenagers distance themselves from thir culture?</h2>
          <p>Most causes to this is due to the fact of the culture itself. Its several factors where most of which are challenged everyday with speaking ones language. Its everyday racism. Starting from the wispers of your classmates with the fact that you are not brown enough, this is an everyday living to those raised in New Zealand. And because of this seeing what hate and stereotype that their parents go through, teens tend to follow on another path as they hide their culture from the wider world. Loosing sight of what was once the culture they spoke.Many Pacific teenagers today sometimes distance themselves from their culture for several reasons. One common reason is the influence of modern society. Teenagers are often surrounded by Western media, such as movies, music, and social media. These influences can make Western lifestyles seem more exciting or “normal,” while their own cultural practices may feel old-fashioned or less popular.

          Another reason is peer pressure. Many young people want to fit in with their friends at school or in the community. If their peers don’t practice cultural traditions or speak their native language, a teenager might feel embarrassed or afraid of being judged. This can lead them to hide or ignore their cultural identity.

          Some Pacific teenagers also face challenges balancing two cultures. At home, they may be expected to follow traditional values, speak their language, or take part in cultural duties. But outside the home, they may need to adapt to a different set of rules and expectations. Managing these differences can be confusing, and some teenagers may choose to push their culture aside to make life easier.

          In some cases, a lack of knowledge plays a role. If young people are not taught their language, customs, or history from a young age, they may feel disconnected from their culture. Without understanding its meaning or importance, they may not feel motivated to continue it.

          Finally, some teenagers may distance themselves because they experience negative stereotypes or discrimination. If they are teased or judged for being Pacific Islanders, they might try to avoid anything that makes them stand out.

          Overall, Pacific teenagers often distance themselves from their culture because of modern pressures, peer influence, identity challenges, lack of cultural knowledge, and fear of judgment. Understanding these reasons can help families and communities find better ways to support and guide young people.</p>

          <h1>The sideview of witholding more than 2 or more cultures?</h1>
          <p>Individuals who navigate more than 3 cultures may experience identidy conflict, feeling caught in two worlds with 2 or more cultural expectations. With this being a being a matter that has not been addressed this adds presure to the child as not all culture are the same. With its tradition and its expectations it is expected that they are meant to obey and acomplish while also abiding by the values that their people see them obeying, causing an impact on them while being caught in two worlds of its culture and its values and expectations. </p>
