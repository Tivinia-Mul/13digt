            <h2>The Impact of Cultural Disconnection on Pacific Teens</h2>
            <p>Pacific teenagers who feel pressured to hide or distance themselves from their culture often experience stronger identity stress and lower emotional wellbeing. Research using the Pacific Identity and Wellbeing Scale (PIWBS) shows that staying connected to Pacific identity supports belonging, confidence, and resilience. But when teens feel unsure about whether they are “Pacific enough” or feel pulled between Pacific and non-Pacific identities, their wellbeing can drop and negative self-perceptions can grow.</p>
 
            <p>Teens who feel less connected to their culture are also more vulnerable online. Studies in Aotearoa New Zealand show that Pacific youth face higher rates of cyberbullying, privacy breaches, and exposure to harmful content. At the same time, digital spaces can act as a support system. Many Pacific teens use social media and online communities to cope with stress, express themselves, and find peer support, but they also report a lack of cultural representation and ongoing concerns about safety and privacy.</p>

            <h2>How Digital Communities Support Pacific Identity</h2>
            <p>Even with these challenges, technology can help Pacific teens reconnect with their identity in meaningful ways. The KPOLYS documentary shows how Pacific teenagers in Aotearoa found belonging and confidence in K-pop communities—safe spaces where their identity is accepted, creativity is encouraged, and stereotypes are broken. For many, these groups eventually sparked a deeper interest in rediscovering their own Pasifika culture.</p>
 
            <p>Initiatives like Rotorua’s Digital Natives Academy also blend culture and technology to empower Māori and Pasifika youth. Through coding, digital art, robotics, gaming, and wellbeing tools, young people develop digital skills while staying grounded in their cultural values. These kinds of spaces show that culture and tech can support each other, helping teens build pride, belonging, and a stronger sense of who they are.</p>
