          <p>For Pacific students—whether Samoan, Tongan, Cook Islander, Fijian, Niuean, Tokelauan, or of mixed Pacific heritage—growing up in Aotearoa or elsewhere often means navigating cultural expectations, stereotypes, and pressure to assimilate; feeling “not Pacific enough” at home and “too Pacific” in a mainstream setting can result in hiding language, cultural behaviours, or identity to avoid judgment or exclusion, but this suppression often leads to identity confusion, isolation, and mental strain; research, including the work of Melani Anae and others, shows that feeling insecure in ethnic identity can damage wellbeing, self-esteem, and a sense of belonging—but those who reclaim and affirm their cultural roots often find grounding, confidence, and mental resilience. Studies of multi‑ethnic Cook Islanders in New Zealand found that exclusion, contested identity, and limited exposure to cultural traditions in childhood left young people feeling disconnected—but as they strengthened cultural knowledge, language, and practices, they experienced deeper belonging and improved mental wellness. Similarly, research with Native Hawaiian young adults shows that high engagement in cultural activities and pride in identity can help manage stress, offering both purpose and coping capacity consistent with cultural reclamation models. That sense of connection is reflected in tools like the Pacific Identity and Wellbeing Scale, which links cultural belonging, group pride, familial support, spirituality, and identity strength to better psychological health—but also reveals that identifying with both Pacific and non-Pacific ethnicities can create identity tension, reducing wellbeing unless consciously addressed. Pacific youth often endure internal pressure—silence in the face of emotional struggles—because expressing vulnerability may bring “shame” on their families, and help-seeking can be dismissed or discouraged by cultural expectations of resilience, spiritual coping, or stoicism; participants in focus groups shared that a dismissive response from a trusted person can reinforce self-reliance and deepen isolation.For those reasons, reclaiming culture through personal-led exploration—not just family expectations, but by seeking out spaces where your interests and identity are embraced—is vital; for example, some Pacific youth in Auckland and Fiji have found belonging through K‑pop dance communities, blending new interests with Pacific identity, breaking stereotypes and creating spaces for self‑expression, grief processing, gender diversity acceptance, and self‑love—showing that identity is multifaceted and that “non‑traditional” interests don’t diminish your Pacific‑ness, but can expand it. As Melani Anae observes, coming to know and affirm your identity—whether you feel “too Pacific or not Pacific enough”—positions you in empowerment, giving you agency in how you live across worlds, resist stereotypes, and do meaningful “mahi” for your people. Education and campus environments can support this journey when teachers and peers learn to know Pacific students as individuals, reflect real differences between Pacific ethnicities, integrate languages and practices in curricula, and avoid tokenistic “tourist” approaches—such culturally responsive teaching can enable Pacific students to bring their whole selves and feel seen and engaged rather than compelled to conceal heritage at school. Mental health frameworks that honour Pasifika worldviews—such as using the talanoa method, engaging families, and integrating spirituality—are more effective in reducing stigma and increasing access to support services, in contrast to Western models that may feel alien or shame‑based; Pacific providers or culturally competent allies are especially helpful. Resilience interventions tailored for young Pacific people, including culturally adapted stories and bibliotherapy in Samoan contexts, have been shown to support emotional regulation, identify with relatable narratives, and strengthen identity in the face of adversity. Online and diaspora communities can also be powerful—Pacific youth across countries find language, stories, memes, creative expression, and shared struggles in social media groups, offering affirmation when physical community is distant or unavailable . Importantly, identity work is not one-off; ongoing engagement—with elders, peers, creative projects, language learning, dance, church or faith, therapy, storytelling, or marae visits—helps rebuild a secure Group Membership Evaluation of being Pacific, nurtures Connectedness and Belonging to wider Pasifika networks, and strengthens family and societal wellbeing as reflected in PIWBS dimensions. It's essential to name and resist identity tension when feeling divided loyalties—particularly if you identify as both Pacific and Pālagi—by consciously weaving heritage and new experiences into a bicultural sense of self that honours both origins and lived context. Though pressure from family, church, or peers may encourage conformity and silence, you deserve safe spaces to express emotion, share struggles without dismissal, and claim your identity without apology; connecting with mentors, Pacific or LGBTQ+ support groups, or peers within culturally affirming communities can help you speak out and release internal burden.Ultimately, reclaiming and embracing your culture—through language, collective practices, creativity, spirituality or everyday acts of pride—is not merely an act of identity, it is a path to mental strength and belonging; it transforms hiding into owning, shame into pride, and silence into voice, allowing you to walk confidently in two (or more) worlds, shape future Pacific narratives (like the Polynesian Panthers once did for political awakening), and participate fully in meaningful mahi for yourself and your moana community.</p>
