            <h3>The Importance of Cultural Identity</h3>
 
            <p>Your cultural identity is the story of who you are. It comes from your family, your traditions, your memories, the things you enjoy, and the communities that shaped you.</p>
 
            <p>People are often judged before they are understood. I have been called a “spoiled white girl from a Catholic school,” even though that is not who I am. My real identity comes from my family, the way I was raised, the food I love, the music I connect with, and the things that make me feel like myself.</p>
 
            <p>I grew up close to my mum’s side of the family. I spent most days with my grandma, and we still have Sunday dinners and holiday gatherings. Every Labor Day weekend, we go to our family camp at Toledo Bend to fish and spend time together. These moments might look small from the outside, but they shaped me into someone who is grounded and family focused.</p>
 
            <p>My age does not always match my personality. I have always been mature for my age and often connect better with older friends. At the same time, I am still a teenager in the way I use my phone and social media, which help me express myself and stay connected.</p>
 
            <p>All of these experiences make up my identity. Everyone has a story like this. When we look beyond stereotypes and take the time to understand where people come from, we discover what truly makes each person unique.</p>
