            <h1>Culture Identity is what makes you who you are. Culture Identity can range from a variety of diffrent things. 
                But in todays culture people do not take the time to learn one another's backround, they judge others based upon apperance. 
                I am mainly looked at as a spoiled, stuck up white girl who went to a catholic school, when none of that is true.
                I have a lot of things that make me who I am, from my family's traditions, to how old I am, the food I enjoy, the music I listen to, and the sport I play.
                We have always been close to my mom's side of the family, from me spending everyday with my grandma since I was born, to having my grandparents over for dinner
                every sunday. We spend every holiday with each other, even if something comes up, we still find a way to see them. My moms side of the family and I have a 
                tradition of going to their camp in Toledo Bend every Labor Day weekend to fis. These traditions might seem like no big deal to others, however it is a
                massive part in who I am today just being family orientated. The number that my age is has never fit with my personality.
                I have always been very mature for my age, with more older friends than most. My age consistsof many diffrent stereotypes. For example, most teenagers enjoy their phone and social media. I definitely fit into that group. Social media plays a bog part in my life.</h1>
