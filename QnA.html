          <h1>Impotance of maintaining ones culture?</h1>
          <p>Culture is the lifeblood of a vibrant society. Exapressed in so many ways that we tell our stories, celebrate, remembering the past, entertain ourselves, and imagine the future. Our creative expression helps define who we are, helping us to see the world through the eyes of those around us.</p>

        <div class="why">
          <h1>Why Pacific teenagers distance themselves from thir culture?</h1>
          <p>Most causes to this is due to the fact of the culture itself. Its several factors where most of which are challenged everyday with speaking ones language. Its everyday racism. Starting from the wispers of your classmates with the fact that you are not brown enough, this is an everyday living to those raised in New Zealand. And because of this seeing what hate and stereotype that their parents go through, teens tend to follow on another path as they hide their culture from the wider world. Loosing sight of what was once the culture they spoke.</p>

        <div class="how">
          <h1>The sideview of witholding more than 2 or more cultures?</h1>
          <p>Individuals who navigate more than 3 cultures may experience identidy conflict, feeling caught in two worlds with 2 or more cultural expectations. With this being a being a matter that has not been addressed this adds presure to the child as not all culture are the same. With its tradition and its expectations it is expected that they are meant to obey and acomplish while also abiding by the values that their people see them obeying, causing an impact on them while being caught in two worlds of its culture and its values and expectations. </p>
